# Band name Generator

## Project Overview

The "Day 1 Band Generator" is a small Python project designed to create a fun and unique band name based on two pieces of personal information: the name of the city where you grew up and the name of your pet. By combining these two elements, the project generates a band name for you.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `band_generator.py`: The Python script that generates the band name.
- `README.md`: This project README file.

## Prerequisites

To run this simple project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Project Structure

The project directory structure looks like this:

```
Day_1_Band_Generator/
│
├── Day_1_Band_Generator.py  # Python script for generating the band name
├── README.md          # Project README file
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Day_1_Band_Generator.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Day_1_Band_Generator
   ```

3. Run the Python script to generate your band name. You will be prompted to input the name of the city where you grew up and the name of your pet.

   ```bash
   python band_generator.py
   ```

4. The script will combine the two inputs and print your unique band name to the console.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the script works:

```plaintext
Enter the name of the city where you grew up: Paris
Enter the name of your pet: Luna

Your band name is: "Paris Luna Band"
```
