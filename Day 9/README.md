# Private Auction Program

## Project Overview

The Private Auction Program is a Python script that facilitates a private auction by collecting bids from participants and determining the highest bidder. This program allows users to enter their name and bid amount. It keeps track of all the bids and identifies the winning bidder at the end of the auction.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/Day 9 Folder**: This folder contains the project file.
  - `Private Auction Program.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook script that runs the Private Auction Program.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To use the Private Auction Program:

1. Open the `Private Auction Program.ipynb` script in a Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab environment.

2. Run the script, and it will prompt you to enter the following information for each bidder:
   - Name: Enter your name.
   - Bid: Enter your bid amount in dollars.

3. After entering your bid, the program will ask if there are any other bidders. You can respond with 'yes' or 'no'.

4. The program will store each bidder's name and bid in a dictionary as long as there are other bidders.

5. Once all the bids have been collected, the program will determine the highest bidder based on the bid amounts.

6. The program will display the name of the winning bidder and the winning bid amount.

7. Enjoy using the Private Auction Program to manage your private auctions and find the highest bidder!

## Prerequisites

To use the Private Auction Program, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can run the Jupyter Notebook script in an environment that supports Jupyter.

## Getting Started

To start using the Private Auction Program:

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `Day 9` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/Day\ 9
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook script, `Private Auction Program.ipynb`, in a Jupyter environment.

4. Run the script, and follow the on-screen prompts to collect bids and determine the winning bidder.

5. Use the program to manage private auctions and identify the highest bidder.

## Customization

You can customize the Private Auction Program by modifying the script to include additional features, such as tracking additional bidder information, providing detailed bid summaries, or implementing other auction rules.
