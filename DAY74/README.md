# Day 74 - Exploring the LEGO Dataset

Today, we'll embark on a deep dive into a comprehensive dataset all about LEGO. This dataset provides an opportunity to explore various aspects of the LEGO company, its product offerings, and discover interesting insights into the world of LEGO sets.

## Key Questions

1. **Enormous LEGO Set:**
   - *Question:* What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created, and how many parts did it have?

2. **LEGO Company Origins:**
   - *Question:* How did the LEGO company start out? In which year were the first LEGO sets released, and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?

3. **Most Prolific LEGO Theme:**
   - *Question:* Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it one of LEGO's own themes like Ninjago, or a theme they licensed, such as Harry Potter or Marvel Superheroes?

4. **Evolution of LEGO's Product Offering:**
   - *Question:* When did the LEGO company significantly expand its product offering? Can we identify a change in the company strategy based on the number of themes and sets released year-on-year?

5. **Size and Complexity of LEGO Sets Over Time:**
   - *Question:* Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?
