# Language Flash Card

## Project Overview

The Language Flash Card project is a Python application built with the Tkinter GUI library. It is designed to help users learn and practice vocabulary words in a foreign language. The program displays a word in the foreign language on the front of a flashcard. The user can click the "Green" button if they know the translation or the "Red" button if they don't. Depending on their choice, the program reveals the English translation or continues to the next word.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/Day 31 Folder**: This folder contains the project files and resources.
  - `main.py`: The main Python script that runs the Language Flash Card program.
  - `images/`: A folder containing image resources used in the program (e.g., card_back.png, card_front.png, right.png, wrong.png).
  - `data/`: A folder containing the data file for language learning (e.g., french_words.csv).
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To use the Language Flash Card program:

1. Open the `main.py` script in a Python environment that supports the Tkinter library.

2. Run the script, and the program's graphical user interface will appear.

3. The program displays the front of a flashcard with a foreign language word.

4. You can click the "Green" button if you know the translation, or the "Red" button if you don't.

5. If you click the "Green" button, the program will reveal the English translation for the word.

6. After 3 seconds, the program will display a new word on the flashcard.

7. If you click the "Red" button, the program will immediately reveal the English translation.

8. You can continue to click the buttons to practice and learn new words.

9. The program will keep track of your progress and adapt to your learning speed.

10. Enjoy using the Language Flash Card to improve your language skills!

## Prerequisites

To run the Language Flash Card program, you need to have Python installed on your system. The program uses the Tkinter library, which is included in the standard Python library. Additionally, the program uses the Pandas library to handle data from the CSV file and the random module to select random words.

## Getting Started

To start using the Language Flash Card program:

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `Day 31` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/Day\ 31
   ```

3. Open the Python script, `main.py`, in a Python environment that supports Tkinter.

4. Run the script, and the Language Flash Card program will be launched.

5. Begin practicing and learning foreign language vocabulary.

## Customization

You can customize the Language Flash Card program by modifying the script to include different word datasets, images, or additional features to enhance the learning experience.
