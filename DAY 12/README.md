# Guessing Game

## Project Overview

The "Guessing Game" is a Python-based text-based game where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player's objective is to guess the chosen number. The game offers two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard, each with different limitations on the number of guesses the player is allowed. The project is a simple, interactive way to challenge your guessing skills.

## Project File

The project consists of the following file:

- `Day_12_Guessing_game.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code for the guessing game.

## Project Rules

Here are the rules and characteristics of the guessing game:

- The computer randomly selects a number within a set range.
- The player's goal is to guess the chosen number.
- The game has two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard.
- In the Easy level, the player has more attempts to guess the number.
- In the Hard level, the player has fewer attempts to guess the number.

## Prerequisites

To play the "Guessing Game," you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads), and Jupyter Notebook can be installed using `pip`.

## Project Structure

The project directory structure looks like this:

```

├── Day_12_Guessing_game.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for the guessing game
├── README.md                   # Project README file
```

## Getting Started

To start playing the "Guessing Game":

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Guessing_Game.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Guessing_Game
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook, "Day_12_Guessing_game.ipynb," using Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Day_12_Guessing_game.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to choose the difficulty level and start playing.

## Example Gameplay

Here's an example of how the game works:

```plaintext
Welcome to the Guessing Game!

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.

Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': easy

You have 10 attempts to guess the number.

Make a guess: 50
Too high.
Guesses left: 9

Make a guess: 25
Too low.
Guesses left: 8

Make a guess: 37
Too high.
Guesses left: 7

Make a guess: 31
Too low.
Guesses left: 6

Make a guess: 34
Too high.
Guesses left: 5

Make a guess: 32
You found the number! It's 32.

You win!

Play again? (yes/no): no
```
