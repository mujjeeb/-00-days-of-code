# Day 73 - Analyze the Popularity of Different Programming Languages over Time

Welcome to "Analyzing the Popularity of Different Programming Languages over Time." This project involves extracting and visualizing data from Stack Overflow to understand the trends in popularity of various programming languages.

## Overview

The project utilizes data obtained from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer through the query: [Popular Programming Languages per Over Time](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/675441/popular-programming-languages-per-over-time-eversql-com). By analyzing this data, we aim to gain insights into the relative popularity of programming languages on Stack Overflow over different time periods.

### Project Structure

The project structure includes the following files:

```
popularity_analysis/
    main.py             # Main script for data extraction and analysis
    QueryResults.csv             # Data
    
```

## Project Functionality

### Data Extraction

- **Stack Exchange Data Explorer:** The query extracts data related to the popularity of programming languages over time from Stack Overflow.

- **CSV Export:** The extracted data is exported to a CSV file for further analysis.

### Data Analysis and Visualization

- **Python Script (`main.ipynb`):** Utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze the data and create visualizations.
