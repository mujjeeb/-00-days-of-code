# Tip Calculator

## Project Overview

The "Tip Calculator" is a Python-based program designed to calculate the tip amount at a restaurant based on the total bill, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill. The project provides an interactive interface to input the required information and then calculates and displays the tip amount per person.

## Project File

The project consists of the following file:

- `Day_2_Tip_Calculator.py`: The Python script that performs the tip calculation based on user inputs.

## How It Works

The "Tip Calculator" works as follows:

1. The program displays a welcome message: "Welcome to the tip calculator."

2. The user is prompted to enter the total bill amount in dollars.

3. The user is asked to choose a tip percentage from the available options (10%, 12%, or 15%).

4. The program then requests the number of people sharing the bill.

5. The script calculates the tip amount based on the provided information and displays the result, including the tip amount per person.

## Prerequisites

To run the "Tip Calculator," you need to have Python installed on your system.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the Tip Calculator works:

```plaintext
Welcome to the tip calculator.

What was the total for your bill $124.56
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
