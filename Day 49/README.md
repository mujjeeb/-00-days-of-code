Welcome to Day 49 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today's project, the "LinkedIn Job Search Bot," takes you into the world of web automation using Selenium. In this project, you'll build a bot that searches LinkedIn for jobs, logs into an account, and saves job listings that match your criteria. It's a powerful tool to streamline your job search and keep track of opportunities on LinkedIn.

## Project Overview

- **main.py**:
  - This script is the heart of the "LinkedIn Job Search Bot."
  - It uses Selenium to automate the following tasks:
    - Login to a LinkedIn account.
    - Search for job listings based on user-defined criteria (e.g., keywords, location, etc.).
    - Save job listings that match the criteria to a list or file.
    - Perform any additional tasks or analysis on the saved job listings.

## Getting Started

To get started with the "LinkedIn Job Search Bot" project, follow these steps:

1. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required libraries using pip:
     ```bash

     ```

2. **WebDriver Setup:**
   - You will need a WebDriver for Selenium. Popular choices include ChromeDriver and GeckoDriver (for Firefox).
   - Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and make sure it's in your system's PATH or specify its path in your script.

3. **Customization:**
   - In the `main.py` script, you can customize various parameters such as your LinkedIn login credentials, job search criteria (e.g., keywords, location, job type), and how you want to save the job listings (e.g., to a file, a list, or further analysis).

4. **Run the App:**
   - Execute the `main.py` script to start your LinkedIn job search automation.
   - The bot will log in to your LinkedIn account, search for jobs, and save relevant job listings based on your criteria.
