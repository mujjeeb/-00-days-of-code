# College Degrees and Their Pay Analysis

## Project Overview

The "College Degrees and Their Pay Analysis" is a comprehensive data analysis project conducted using a Jupyter Notebook. The project explores data related to college majors and their corresponding salaries to determine which majors offer the highest Return on Investment (ROI) in terms of earnings. The analysis aims to answer several questions, including which degrees have the highest starting salaries, which majors have the lowest earnings after college, which degrees have the highest earning potential, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/DAY 71 Folder**: This folder contains the project files and resources.
  - `DAY71_COLLEGE_SALARY.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook script that contains the comprehensive analysis of college degrees and their pay.
  - `salaries_by_college_major.csv`: The dataset containing information on college majors and their corresponding salaries.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To explore the "College Degrees and Their Pay Analysis":

1. Open the `DAY71_COLLEGE_SALARY.ipynb` script in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

2. Follow the step-by-step analysis provided in the notebook to answer questions related to college degrees, starting salaries, earning potential, and more.

3. Execute code cells, visualize data, and analyze the findings to gain insights into the relationship between college majors and earnings.

4. The notebook provides explanations, visualizations, and code snippets to facilitate the analysis process.

## Prerequisites

To run and explore the "College Degrees and Their Pay Analysis," you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Additionally, the provided dataset, `salaries_by_college_major.csv`, should be available in the project directory.

## Getting Started

To start exploring the "College Degrees and Their Pay Analysis":

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `DAY 71` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/DAY\ 71
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook script, `DAY71_COLLEGE_SALARY.ipynb`, in a Jupyter environment.

4. Begin your analysis by following the provided instructions in the notebook.

5. Run code cells to obtain insights into college degrees and their pay.

## Example Analysis

Here's an example of the analysis you can perform in the notebook:

1. Open the `DAY71_COLLEGE_SALARY.ipynb` script in a Jupyter environment.

2. Load the provided dataset, `salaries_by_college_major.csv`, and perform data exploration.

3. Analyze which degrees have the highest starting salaries, which majors have the lowest earnings after college, and which degrees have the highest earning potential.

4. Use data visualization techniques to present the findings in a clear and informative manner.

5. Explore the relationship between different types of degrees, such as business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), and HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science), in terms of average earnings.
