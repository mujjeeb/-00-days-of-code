# Car Game

## Project Overview

The "Car Game" is a Python-based arcade game where the player controls a car that moves upward on the screen while avoiding oncoming traffic. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by successfully avoiding collisions with the other cars on the road. The project consists of four Python files: `main.py`, `player.py`, `scoreboard.py`, and `car_manager.py`. These files work together to create an engaging and challenging game.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

1. `main.py`: This is the main script for running the game. It initiates the game, sets up the display, and handles user input.

2. `player.py`: Contains the logic for controlling the player's car, including its movement.

3. `scoreboard.py`: Defines the behavior and display of the game's scoreboard, keeping track of the player's score.

4. `car_manager.py`: Manages the behavior of the oncoming traffic cars, including their movement and collisions.

## Game Rules

Here are the rules and characteristics of the "Car Game":

- The player controls a car that moves upward on the screen.
- The player scores points for successfully avoiding collisions with the oncoming traffic cars.
- The game keeps track of the player's score using a scoreboard.
- If the player's car collides with any of the oncoming traffic cars, the game is over.
- The player can control the car's movement using keyboard input.

## Prerequisites

To run the "Car Game," you need to have Python and any required Python libraries installed on your system.

## Project Structure

The project directory structure looks like this:

```
Car_Game/
│
├── main.py        # Main script for running the game
├── player.py      # Player car movement and control
├── scoreboard.py  # Scoreboard behavior and display
├── car_manager.py # Oncoming traffic car management
├── README.md      # Project README file
```

## Getting Started

To start playing the "Car Game":

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Car_Game.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Car_Game
   ```

3. Run the main script, `main.py`, to start the game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Use the keyboard controls to move the player's car and avoid oncoming traffic. Try to score as many points as possible without colliding with other cars.

## Example Gameplay

Here's an example of how the game works:

```plaintext
Welcome to the Car Game!

Use the 'Up'  arrow key to move the car.
Press 'Space' to start the game.

Score: 0

Game Over! Your final score is 112.

Thank you for playing the Car Game!
```
