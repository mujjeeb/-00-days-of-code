# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Coding Challenge** repository! This is an exciting journey where I commit to coding every day for the next 100 days. I am embarking on this journey to establish a coding habit. This challenge is designed to help me stay consistent, improve my skills, and make meaningful progress.
As a product manager in my day job, I hope this challenge helps me resolve some of the communication, collaboration, and decision-making issues I have with my team and would lead to better execution and higher-quality products.

## What is the Challenge?

The challenge is simple: code for a minimum of one hour every day, for 100 consecutive days. This could involve working on personal projects, practicing coding exercises, learning new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or any other coding-related activity that aligns with my goals.
