# Personalized Bulk Letter Generator

## Project Overview

The "Personalized Bulk Letter Generator" is a Python-based script that automates the process of customizing and generating personalized letters for a list of recipients. The project consists of two folders, an `input` folder, an `output` folder, and the main script, `main.py`. The `input` folder contains a file named `invited_names.txt` and a `Letters` folder that contains a starting letter, `starting_letter.txt`. The `output` folder includes a `ReadyToSend` folder where the customized letters will be saved.

## Project Files and Folders

The project consists of the following files and folders:

- `main.py`: This is the main Python script that reads the list of recipient names and generates customized letters for each recipient based on the starting letter template.

- `input/`: This folder contains the input files and data for the project.
  - `invited_names.txt`: A text file that contains the list of names of the recipients.
  - `Letters/`: A subfolder that contains the starting letter template, `starting_letter.txt`.

- `output/`: This folder contains the output files generated by the script.
  - `ReadyToSend/`: A subfolder where the customized letters, in the form `letter_for_{name}.txt`, will be saved.

## How It Works

The "Personalized Bulk Letter Generator" works as follows:

1. The script reads the list of recipient names from the `invited_names.txt` file in the `input` folder.

2. It loads the starting letter template from the `starting_letter.txt` file in the `Letters` subfolder of the `input` folder.

3. For each recipient name, the script customizes the letter by replacing a placeholder (e.g., "{name}") with the recipient's name.

4. The customized letter for each recipient is then saved as a separate text file in the `ReadyToSend` folder within the `output` folder. Each file is named in the format `letter_for_{name}.txt`.
