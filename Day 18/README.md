# Turtle Drawing of Damien Hirst's "Spots" Painting

## Project Overview

This project recreates the artwork of Damien Hirst's "Spots" painting using the Python Turtle module. The artwork features a series of colorful spots arranged in a grid pattern. The Turtle module is used to draw these spots and create a digital representation of the artwork.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/DAY 18 Folder**: This folder contains the project file and resources.
  - `main.py`: The Python script that uses the Turtle module to recreate Damien Hirst's "Spots" painting.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To recreate Damien Hirst's "Spots" painting using the Turtle module:

1. Open the `main.py` script in a Python environment that supports the Turtle module.

2. Run the script, and a new window will open with the Turtle graphics screen.

3. The script will use Turtle graphics to draw colorful spots in a grid pattern, replicating the artwork's style.

4. The spots are arranged in a visually pleasing manner, recreating the essence of Damien Hirst's painting.

5. You can customize the colors and patterns of the spots by modifying the script to achieve different artistic effects.

6. Enjoy the process of watching the Turtle module recreate the artwork.

## Prerequisites

To run the project and recreate Damien Hirst's "Spots" painting, you need to have Python installed on your system. The project utilizes the Turtle module, which is included in the standard Python library.

## Getting Started

To start recreating Damien Hirst's "Spots" painting:

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `DAY 18` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/DAY\ 18
   ```

3. Open the Python script, `main.py`, in a Python environment that supports the Turtle module.

4. Run the script, and the Turtle graphics screen will display the recreation of the artwork.

5. Observe the colorful spots being drawn in a grid pattern to replicate the "Spots" painting.

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the `main.py` script. Consider experimenting with different colors, spot sizes, grid arrangements, or even creating your own variations of the artwork.
