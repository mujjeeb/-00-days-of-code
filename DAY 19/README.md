# Turtle Racing Game

## Project Overview

The "Turtle Racing Game" is a Python-based game that simulates a race between turtles of different colors. In this interactive game, the user is prompted to choose which turtle they believe will win the race by selecting the turtle's color. After the user places their bet, the turtles race across the screen. At the end of the race, the script compares the winning turtle to the user's bet, and the user's outcome is revealed.
