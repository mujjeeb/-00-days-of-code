# Day 81 - Boston Housing Price Prediction Model

Welcome to Boston, Massachusetts, in the 1970s! In this project, you step into the shoes of a data scientist working for a real estate development company. Your task is to build a model that can estimate the price of residential properties based on various characteristics such as the number of rooms, distance to employment centers, neighborhood affluence, student-teacher ratios in local schools, and more.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following files:

```
day81_boston_housing_prediction/
    Multivariable_Regression_and_Valuation_Model.ipynb   # Jupyter notebook for building the price prediction model
    boston_housing_data.csv           # Dataset: Boston housing data with relevant features
```

## Key Features Considered

1. **Number of Rooms:**
   - Analyze how the number of rooms in a property correlates with its price.
