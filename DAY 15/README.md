# Coffee Machine

## Project Overview

The "Coffee Machine" is a Python-based interactive program that simulates a coffee vending machine. It allows users to select from a menu of coffee options (espresso, latte, cappuccino) and make payments using various denominations of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies). The machine then serves the chosen coffee and provides change if necessary.

## Project File

The project consists of the following file:

- `Day15_Coffee_Machine.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code for the coffee machine.

## Project Features

The Coffee Machine offers the following features:

- Menu of coffee options: espresso, latte, cappuccino.
- Payment input: Users can insert quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies to pay for their coffee.
- Change calculation: The machine calculates and returns change if the payment exceeds the coffee price.
- Coffee preparation: The machine prepares and serves the selected coffee.
- Resource report: Users can request a report showing the remaining resources (water, milk, coffee) and the amount of money in the register.

## Prerequisites

To run the "Coffee Machine," you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads), and Jupyter Notebook can be installed using `pip`.

```

## Getting Started

To start using the "Coffee Machine":

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Coffee_Machine.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Coffee_Machine
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook, "Day15_Coffee_Machine.ipynb," using Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Day15_Coffee_Machine.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to interact with the coffee machine, make coffee selections, and make payments.

## Example Interaction

Here's an example of how the coffee machine works:

```plaintext
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino) or off to turn off the machine: latte
Please insert the amount of quarters that would be used? 2
Please insert the amount of dimes that would be used? 34
Please insert the amount of nickels that would be used? 3
Please insert the amount of pennies that would be used? 3

Here is your change: $1.58
Enjoy your latte, have a nice day!

Would you like a resource report? Type 'Y' for Yes or 'N' for No: Y

We have 100ml of water, 50ml of milk, and 76g of coffee left, and $2.50 in the register.
```
