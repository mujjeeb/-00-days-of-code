# Snake Game

## Project Overview

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game built in Python using the Turtle module. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself. The goal is to achieve the highest score by collecting as much food as possible. The game is simple to play but can be addictive and challenging.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/Day 20 & 21 Folder**: This folder contains the project files and resources.
  - `main.py`: The main Python script that runs the Snake Game.
  - `food.py`: A module that manages the food in the game.
  - `snake.py`: A module that controls the behavior of the snake.
  - `scoreboard.py`: A module responsible for keeping track of the score and displaying it.
  - `data.txt`: A text file that stores the highscore.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To play the Snake Game:

1. Open the `main.py` script in a Python environment that supports the Turtle module.

2. Run the script, and a new window will open with the game screen.

3. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).

4. The snake will move in the direction you specify, and your goal is to eat the food that appears on the screen.

5. As the snake eats food, it will grow longer, and your score will increase.

6. Be careful not to let the snake collide with the walls or itself, as that will end the game.

7. The game keeps track of your highscore and displays it on the screen.

8. Enjoy playing and try to beat your highscore!

## Prerequisites

To play the Snake Game, you need to have Python installed on your system. The game uses the Turtle module, which is included in the standard Python library.

## Getting Started

To start playing the Snake Game:

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `Day 20 & 21` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/Day\ 20\ \&\ 21
   ```

3. Open the Python script, `main.py`, in a Python environment that supports the Turtle module.

4. Run the script, and the Snake Game will start.

5. Control the snake with the arrow keys and aim for the highest score.

## Highscore

The game keeps track of the highscore, which is stored in the `data.txt` file. The highscore is updated whenever you achieve a new personal best.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the scripts in the project, such as changing the appearance of the snake, food, or the game screen.
