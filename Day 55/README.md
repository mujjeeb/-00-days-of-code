Welcome to Day 55 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! In today's project, the "Higher or Lower Game," we'll build an interactive web-based guessing game using Python and the Flask framework. The game asks users to guess a randomly selected number and provides hints to guide them to the correct answer.

## Project Overview

- **server.py**:
  - The "Higher or Lower Game" project is implemented in this Python script using the Flask web framework.
  - The game's key features include:
    - Generating a random number between 0 and 9.
    - Allowing users to guess the number via the web interface.
    - Providing feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
  - The project creates a basic web application that can be accessed through a web browser.

## Getting Started

To get started with the "Higher or Lower Game" project, follow these steps:

1. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the Flask library using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install flask
     ```

2. **Running the Game:**
   - Run the `server.py` script to start the Flask development server.
   - The game can be accessed in a web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

- The "Higher or Lower Game" is an entertaining and interactive guessing game suitable for users of all ages.
- Players can enjoy guessing the correct number and receive real-time feedback on their guesses.

## Customization

- Customize the game by modifying the range of random numbers, game rules, and web interface to match your preferences.
- Add more features like keeping score, tracking the number of attempts, or integrating with a database for leaderboard functionality.
