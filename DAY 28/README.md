# Pomodoro Timer

## Project Overview

The "Pomodoro Timer" is a Python project that provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for applying the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The project utilizes the Tkinter library to create an intuitive timer interface with customizable work and break durations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/DAY 27 Folder**: This folder contains the project files and resources.
  - `main.py`: The main Python script that runs the Pomodoro Timer.
  - `tomato.png`: An image file used in the GUI interface.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To use the "Pomodoro Timer":

1. Run the `main.py` script.

2. The GUI interface will open, displaying a start button and a tomato timer icon.

3. By default, the timer is set to 25 minutes for work sessions and 5 minutes for short breaks. You can customize these durations by clicking the "Settings" button.

4. Click the "Start" button to begin a work session. The timer will count down from the specified work duration.

5. When the work session ends, you will hear an alert sound, and the timer will automatically switch to the break session for the specified break duration.

6. After the break session ends, the timer will reset to the work session, and you can start another Pomodoro session by clicking "Start" again.

7. You can also pause or reset the timer as needed using the buttons provided.

## Prerequisites

To run the "Pomodoro Timer," you need to have Python installed on your system. Tkinter is included in the standard Python library, so there is no need for additional installations.

## Getting Started

To start using the "Pomodoro Timer":

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `DAY 27` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/DAY\ 27
   ```

3. Run the Python script, `main.py`, to start the Pomodoro Timer:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Use the GUI interface to manage your work and break sessions with the Pomodoro Technique.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the Pomodoro Timer works:

1. Open the GUI interface by running `main.py`.

2. The default work duration is set to 25 minutes, and the default break duration is 5 minutes.

3. Click the "Start" button to begin a work session. The timer will count down from 25 minutes.

4. After 25 minutes, you will hear an alert sound, and the timer will switch to a 5-minute break session.

5. After the break session, the timer will reset to another 25-minute work session, and you can continue using the Pomodoro Technique.

6. You can pause or reset the timer as needed using the buttons in the GUI.
