Welcome to Day 46 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Get ready for a musical journey through time with the "Musical Time Machine." This project will take you back to the hit songs of the past. It's a fun project that scrapes the Billboard Hot 100 for a specific date, extracts artist and song names, and creates a Spotify playlist with the top 100 songs. Let's dive in and relive the music of yesteryears!

## Project Overview

- **main.py**:
  - The heart of the "Musical Time Machine," this script prompts the user to enter a date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
  - It then scrapes the Billboard Hot 100 for that date, retrieving the top 100 songs.
  - The script formats the response, extracts artist names and song titles, and compiles them into a playlist.

- **spotipy.py**:
  - This module utilizes the Spotify API and the Spotipy library to create a Spotify playlist.
  - You will need to provide your Spotipy credentials to make it all work.
