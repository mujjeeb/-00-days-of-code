# Day 77 - Image Manipulation: A Lesson on NumPy

Welcome to "Image Manipulation: A Lesson on NumPy." In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamental use of NumPy, a powerful numerical computing library in Python, and apply it to manipulate images. The provided Jupyter notebook, `Computation_with_NumPy_and_N_Dimensional_Arrays.ipynb`, guides you through basic NumPy operations and image manipulation techniques.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following files:

```
day77_image_manipulation/
    Computation_with_NumPy_and_N_Dimensional_Arrays.ipynb   # Jupyter notebook
    yummy_macarons.jpg                                     # Sample image for manipulation
```

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Introduction to NumPy:**
   - Explore the basics of NumPy, including array creation, indexing, and operations.

2. **N-Dimensional Arrays:**
   - Understand the concept of N-dimensional arrays and their applications.

3. **Image Manipulation with NumPy:**
   - Apply NumPy operations to manipulate images.
   - Perform operations such as cropping, rotating, and changing pixel values.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
