# Simple Calculator

## Project Overview

The "Simple Calculator with Functions" project is a basic Python program that provides a command-line calculator with four fundamental operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project is designed to demonstrate the use of functions to perform mathematical calculations.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `simple_calculator.py`: The Python script that contains the calculator functions and user interface.
- `README.md`: This project README file.

## Prerequisites

To run this simple calculator project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Project Structure

The project directory structure looks like this:

```
Simple_Calculator/
│
├── simple_calculator.py  # Python script with calculator functions
├── README.md             # Project README file
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Simple_Calculator.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Simple_Calculator
   ```

3. Run the Python script to start the calculator:

   ```bash
   python simple_calculator.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the calculator works:

```plaintext
Simple Calculator

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Quit

Select an operation (1/2/3/4/5): 1
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 + 5 = 15

Select an operation (1/2/3/4/5): 3
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 4

Result: 8 * 4 = 32

Select an operation (1/2/3/4/5): 5
```
