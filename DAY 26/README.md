# NATO Alphabet Generator

## Project Overview

The "NATO Alphabet Generator" is a Python-based project that allows you to convert a word or a phrase into the corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet words. The NATO phonetic alphabet, also known as the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, is a standardized phonetic alphabet used in aviation and other contexts to ensure clear and unambiguous communication.

## Project Files and Folder

The project is organized in the following way:

- **DAY_26 Folder**: This folder contains the project files and resources.
  - `main.py`: The main Python script that runs the NATO Alphabet Generator.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

1. Run the `main.py` script.

2. Enter the word or phrase you want to convert into the NATO phonetic alphabet.

3. The script will generate the corresponding NATO alphabet words for each letter in the input word or phrase.

4. The output will display the NATO alphabet words, making it easier to spell out words in a clear and standardized manner.
