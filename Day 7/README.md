# Hangman Game

## Project Overview

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game built in Python. In this game, the player is presented with a hidden word, and they must guess letters one at a time to reveal the word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The player must guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn to win the game. The game provides a fun and challenging way to test your word-guessing skills.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/Day 7 Folder**: This folder contains the project files and resources.
  - `hangman_art.py`: A module that provides ASCII art for the hangman's gallows.
  - `hangman_words.py`: A module that contains a list of words for the game.
  - `main.py`: The main Python script that runs the Hangman Game.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To play the Hangman Game:

1. Open the `main.py` script in a Python environment.

2. Run the script, and the game will start.

3. The game will randomly select a word from the list of words provided in `hangman_words.py`.

4. You will see a series of underscores representing the letters of the word to guess.

5. Guess letters one at a time by entering them using the keyboard.

6. The game will inform you whether your guess is correct and reveal any occurrences of the guessed letter in the word.

7. Incorrect guesses will result in parts of the hangman being drawn, one piece at a time.

8. You must guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn to win the game.

9. The game keeps track of your wins and losses, and you can play multiple rounds.

10. Have fun testing your word-guessing skills with the Hangman Game!

## Prerequisites

To play the Hangman Game, you need to have Python installed on your system. No additional libraries are required, as the game uses built-in Python functions and modules.

## Getting Started

To start playing the Hangman Game:

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `Day 7` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/Day\ 7
   ```

3. Open the Python script, `main.py`, in a Python environment.

4. Run the script, and the Hangman Game will begin.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the hidden word and enjoy the game.

## Customization

You can customize the Hangman Game by modifying the `hangman_words.py` file to include your own words for the game. You can also adjust the ASCII art in `hangman_art.py` to change the appearance of the hangman.
