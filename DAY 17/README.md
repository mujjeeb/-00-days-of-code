# Trivia

## Project Overview

The "Trivia" is a Python-based project designed to present the user with a series of questions and evaluate their answers. The project is divided into four Python files: `main.py`, `data.py`, `question_model.py`, and `quiz_brain.py`. When the `main.py` script is run, it interacts with the other files to present questions to the user, keep track of the user's score, and provide a final score at the end of the quiz.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

1. `main.py`: The main Python script that initiates the quiz, presents questions, keeps score, and displays the final result.
2. `data.py`: Contains the data for the questions and answers.
3. `question_model.py`: Defines the structure of a question, including the text and answer.
4. `quiz_brain.py`: Manages the quiz logic, checks answers, and keeps track of the score and question number.

## Prerequisites

To run the "Trivia," you need to have Python installed on your system.

The project directory structure looks like this:
