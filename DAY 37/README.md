# Day 37 of 100 Days of Code

## Habit Tracker with Pixela

Welcome to Day 37 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today's project is a "Habit Tracker" application that interacts with the [Pixela API](https://pixe.la/). This project focuses on using various HTTP request methods such as POST, PUT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Let's get started.

## Project Overview

The "Habit Tracker with Pixela" project includes a single file:

- **main.py**:
  - This script demonstrates the usage of HTTP request methods to interact with the [Pixela API](https://pixe.la/):
    - It utilizes POST requests to create a new user and habit.
    - PUT requests to update habit details.
    - UPDATE requests to record daily habits.
    - DELETE requests to remove habits or user data.
  - This project primarily serves as an educational exercise to familiarize yourself with these request methods and the Pixela API.

## Getting Started

To run the "Habit Tracker with Pixela" project, follow these steps:

1. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```

2. **Pixela Configuration:**
   - You will need to create an account on [Pixela](https://pixe.la/) and obtain an API token.
   - Open the `main.py` script and provide your Pixela API token, username, and other details as needed.
   - Customize the habit names, goals, and other settings.

3. **Run the App:**
   - Execute the `main.py` script to start the "Habit Tracker with Pixela" app.
   - The script will showcase the usage of POST, PUT, UPDATE, and DELETE requests with Pixela.

## Usage

- The "Habit Tracker with Pixela" app is primarily for educational purposes and demonstrates how to work with the Pixela API using different HTTP request methods.
- You can customize the script to experiment with different API endpoints and features offered by Pixela.

## Customization

- Modify the script to create, update, or delete habits, user data, or any other Pixela features based on your learning goals.
- Feel free to explore the Pixela API documentation to discover additional functionalities.
