# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Project Overview

The "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game is a simple text-based Python project that allows players to play the classic hand game against the computer. The game involves selecting one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects one of these options as well. The game's outcome is determined based on the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. ASCII art is used to illustrate the user and computer choices, making the game more engaging.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **DAY 4 Folder**: This folder contains the project file.
  - `Day_4_Rock_paper_scissors.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook script that runs the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.

## How It Works

To play the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game:

1. Open the `Day_4_Rock_paper_scissors.ipynb` script in a Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab environment.

2. Follow the game's prompts to select your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

3. The computer will randomly select one of the three options as well.

4. The game will determine the winner based on the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

5. The outcome of the game will be displayed along with ASCII art illustrations of your and the computer's choices.

6. You can play the game multiple times or exit when you're done.

## Prerequisites

To play the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can run the Jupyter Notebook script in an environment that supports Jupyter.
