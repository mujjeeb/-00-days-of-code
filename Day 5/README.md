# Password Generator

## Project Overview

The Password Generator is a simple Python program designed to create strong and random passwords based on user-defined criteria. By specifying the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password, the program generates secure and unique combinations to enhance online security.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/Day 5 Folder**: This folder contains the project file.
  - `Day_5_password_generator.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook script that runs the Password Generator.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To use the Password Generator:

1. Open the `Day_5_password_generator.ipynb` script in a Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab environment.

2. Run the script, and it will prompt you to specify the following for your password:
   - Number of letters
   - Number of symbols
   - Number of numbers

3. Enter the desired quantities for each category.

4. The program will then generate a random password based on your preferences.

5. The generated password will be displayed in the notebook, and you can use it for secure online accounts.

6. You can customize the password length and complexity by adjusting the quantities of letters, symbols, and numbers.

## Prerequisites

To run the Password Generator, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can run the Jupyter Notebook script in an environment that supports Jupyter.

## Getting Started

To start using the Password Generator:

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `Day 5` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/Day\ 5
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook script, `Day_5_password_generator.ipynb`, in a Jupyter environment.

4. Run the script, and it will guide you through the process of generating a secure password.

5. Customize the password according to your security requirements.

## Customization

You can customize the Password Generator by modifying the script to include additional character types, adjust the length of the generated password, or implement other password complexity requirements.
