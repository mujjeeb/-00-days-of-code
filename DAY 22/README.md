# Ping Pong with Turtle

## Project Overview

"Ping Pong with Turtle" is a classic Python-based game that simulates the popular ping pong game using the Turtle graphics library. The project consists of four Python files: `ball.py`, `main.py`, `scoreboard.py`, and `paddle.py`. These files work together to create an interactive game where the player controls a paddle to hit the ball and score points while trying to avoid missing the ball.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

1. `ball.py`: This Python script defines the behavior of the ball in the game, including its movement and interactions with the paddles and walls.

2. `main.py`: The main Python script for running the game. It initiates the game, sets up the display, and handles user input.

3. `scoreboard.py`: Defines the behavior and display of the game's scoreboard, keeping track of the player's score.

4. `paddle.py`: Contains the logic for the player-controlled paddle's movement and interactions.

## Game Rules

Here are the rules and characteristics of "Ping Pong with Turtle":

- The player controls a paddle to hit a ball as it bounces off the walls.
- The player scores points for each successful hit of the ball.
- If the player misses the ball, the game is over.
- The game keeps track of the player's score using a scoreboard.
- The player can control the paddle's movement using keyboard input.

## Prerequisites

To run "Ping Pong with Turtle," you need to have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed on your system.

## Getting Started

To start playing "Ping Pong with Turtle":

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ping_Pong_with_Turtle.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
