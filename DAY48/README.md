Welcome to Day 48 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today's project, "Cookie Clicker & More with Selenium," is a fascinating journey into web automation using Selenium. In this project, you'll explore four exciting mini-projects, each demonstrating the power and versatility of Selenium. From clicking cookies to scraping Python events and automating form filling, this project has it all!

## Project Overview

### Cookie Clicker (cookie_clicker.py)

- **cookie_clicker.py**:
  - Get ready to become a Cookie Clicker champion! In this mini-project, you'll build a bot that plays the [Cookie Clicker game](http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/).
  - The bot clicks the cookie and buys upgrades, all while tracking its cookie wealth.

### Python Event Finder (python_event.py)

- **python_event.py**:
  - Explore the Python programming world! In this mini-project, you'll scrape the [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) website to find Python-related events you can attend.
  - This project could be extended to include functionalities like sending email notifications or searching for events in a specific area or featuring a particular speaker.

### Wiki Python Search (wiki_python_search.py)

- **wiki_python_search.py**:
  - Dive into the world of Python-related knowledge! This mini-project builds a bot that searches Wikipedia for Python-related articles.
  - Learn how to retrieve valuable information efficiently from the vast sea of data on Wikipedia.

### Form Filler (fill_form.py)

- **fill_form.py**:
  - Automate form filling on web applications! In this mini-project, you'll build a bot that automatically fills out a web form.
  - Experience how automation can simplify and expedite repetitive data entry tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the "Cookie Clicker & More with Selenium" project, follow these steps:

1. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install selenium
     ```

2. **WebDriver Setup:**
   - You will need a WebDriver for Selenium. Popular choices include ChromeDriver and GeckoDriver (for Firefox).
   - Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and make sure it's in your system's PATH or specify its path in your scripts.

3. **Customization:**
   - For each mini-project, open the respective script and customize it to fit your preferences. For example, you can change the website URL, add email functionality, or fine-tune search parameters.

4. **Run the Mini-Projects:**
   - Execute each mini-project script (e.g., `cookie_clicker.py`, `python_event.py`, etc.) to see Selenium in action.

## Usage

- The "Cookie Clicker & More with Selenium" project provides hands-on experience in web automation and scraping using Selenium.
- Use the mini-projects as a starting point to create your own web automation solutions and save time on repetitive tasks.

## Customization

- Extend the functionality of each mini-project or create entirely new automation scenarios.
- Explore Selenium's capabilities for web scraping, form filling, and more.

## Credits

This project is part of the 100 Days of Code challenge and is designed for educational and practical purposes. It's a fantastic opportunity to learn web automation and web scraping using Selenium.
