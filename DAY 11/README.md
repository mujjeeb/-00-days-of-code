#  Blackjack 

## Project Overview

The "Simple Blackjack Game" is a Python-based text-based game that simulates the popular casino card game, Blackjack. This project follows the classic rules of Blackjack, where the objective is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The project provides a simple console interface for you to play against the computer, which acts as the dealer.

## Project Rules

The Blackjack game adheres to the following rules:

- The deck is unlimited in size.
- There are no jokers.
- The Jack, Queen, and King all count as 10.
- The Ace can count as 11 or 1, depending on what's more favorable to the player.
- The deck of cards consists of the following values: [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10].
- The cards in the list have an equal probability of being drawn.
- Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
- The computer is the dealer.
