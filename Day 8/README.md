# Caesar's Cipher

## Project Overview

The Caesar's Cipher project is a simple Python program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher technique. The Caesar cipher is a basic form of encryption that shifts the letters of a message by a fixed number of positions. This project provides a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding messages based on a specified shift value.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/Day 8 Folder**: This folder contains the project file.
  - `main.py`: The main Python script that implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To use the Caesar's Cipher program:

1. Open the `main.py` script in a Python environment.

2. Run the script, and it will prompt you for the following information:
   - Direction: Enter 'encode' to encrypt a message or 'decode' to decrypt a message.
   - Text: Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
   - Shift: Enter the shift value, which is the number of positions to shift the letters.

3. The program will then process your input based on the chosen direction (encode or decode).

4. The result, either the encrypted or decrypted message, will be displayed in the console.

5. Enjoy using the Caesar's Cipher to encode and decode messages with different shift values.

## Prerequisites

To use the Caesar's Cipher program, you need to have Python installed on your system. No additional libraries or dependencies are required, as the project uses built-in Python functions.

## Getting Started

To start using the Caesar's Cipher program:

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `Day 8` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/Day\ 8
   ```

3. Open the Python script, `main.py`, in a Python environment.

4. Run the script, and follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt your messages using the Caesar cipher.

## Customization

You can customize the Caesar's Cipher program by modifying the script to include additional features or encryption methods. For example, you can expand the character set to include special characters, use different shift algorithms, or implement additional security measures.
