# DeathBed Game

## Project Overview

**DeathBed** is an interactive text-based Python game that challenges players to answer a series of random questions. The objective of the game is to answer the questions and progress through various scenarios. The game is designed to be engaging and entertaining, with unexpected twists and turns that lead players to their final "deathbed."

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/DAY 29 Folder**: This folder contains the project file and resources.
  - `Day_3_Deathbed_.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook script that runs the DeathBed Game.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To play the **DeathBed Game**:

1. Open the `Day_3_Deathbed_.ipynb` script in a Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab environment.

2. Follow the game's prompts and answer the questions that appear throughout the game.

3. Your responses to the questions will determine your path through the game. Different answers may lead to various scenarios, some of which could be fatal, while others may keep you alive.

4. The game's objective is to explore different scenarios and try to reach your final "deathbed."

5. Enjoy the unexpected twists and turns as you navigate your way through the game's challenges.

## Prerequisites

To play the **DeathBed Game**, you need to have Python and a Jupyter Notebook environment installed on your system.

## Getting Started

To start playing the **DeathBed Game**:

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `DAY 29` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/DAY\ 29
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook script, `Day_3_Deathbed_.ipynb`, in a Jupyter environment.

5. Enjoy the suspense and humor as you progress through the game.

## Example Gameplay

Here's an example of how the **DeathBed Game** works:

1. Open the `Day_3_Deathbed_.ipynb` script in a Jupyter environment.

2. Start the game and answer the first question. Your answer will determine your next scenario.

3. Depending on your response, you may encounter different challenges and scenarios, some of which may lead you to your "deathbed."

4. The game is designed to be unpredictable, so there are multiple paths to explore, each with its own unique outcomes.
