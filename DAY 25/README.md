# Name the State Game

## Project Overview

The "Name the State Game" is a Python-based educational game that leverages the Turtle graphics library. The project consists of three files: `main.py`, `50_states.csv`, and `blank_states_img.gif`. This interactive game presents the user with a blank map of the United States and challenges them to name all 50 states. As the user enters the names of the states, the Turtle graphics library updates the map, displaying the correctly named states on the map.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

1. `main.py`: The main Python script for running the game. It loads the blank map of the United States, interacts with the user to gather state names, and updates the map with the correctly named states.

2. `50_states.csv`: A CSV file that contains the names of all 50 states in the United States.

3. `blank_states_img.gif`: An image file that serves as the blank map of the United States.

## How It Works

The "Name the State Game" operates as follows:

1. The script loads the blank map of the United States, displaying an image of the map on the screen.

2. The user is prompted to enter the names of the 50 states, one by one.

3. As the user enters the name of a state, the script checks if the name matches any of the states in the provided list.

4. If the name matches a state, the script uses the Turtle graphics library to update the map by displaying the name of the correctly identified state in its corresponding location.

5. The user continues naming states until all 50 states are correctly named or until they decide to exit the game.

## Prerequisites

To run the "Name the State Game," you need to have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed on your system.
