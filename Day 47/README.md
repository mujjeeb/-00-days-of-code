Welcome to Day 47 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, we introduce the "Amazon Price Checker" â€“ a powerful tool to track the price of your favorite Amazon products. It allows you to set a target price, and if the current price drops below your target, you'll receive an email alert. Let's dive into this project and keep an eye on those amazing deals!

## Project Overview

- **send_email.py**:
  - This module handles the email functionality.
  - You can customize the email subject, message format, and recipient email address.
  - The script uses the `smtplib` library for sending email alerts.
