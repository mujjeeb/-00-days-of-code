# Miles to Kilometer Converter

## Project Overview

The "Miles to Kilometer Converter" is a Python project that provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for converting distances from miles to kilometers. It utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple and intuitive interface where users can input a distance in miles and receive the equivalent distance in kilometers.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **100-days-of-code/DAY 27 Folder**: This folder contains the project files and resources.
  - `main.py`: The main Python script that runs the Miles to Kilometer Converter.
  - `README.md`: The project README file.

## How It Works

To use the "Miles to Kilometer Converter":

1. Run the `main.py` script.

2. The GUI interface will open, providing an input field for entering the distance in miles.

3. After entering the distance in miles, click the "Convert" button.

4. The equivalent distance in kilometers will be displayed below.

5. You can continue to enter and convert multiple distances.

## Prerequisites

To run the "Miles to Kilometer Converter," you need to have Python installed on your system. Tkinter is included in the standard Python library, so there is no need for additional installations.

## Getting Started

To start using the "Miles to Kilometer Converter":

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the `DAY 27` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 100-days-of-code/DAY\ 27
   ```

3. Run the Python script, `main.py`, to start the Miles to Kilometer Converter:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Use the GUI interface to input distances in miles and convert them to kilometers.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the Miles to Kilometer Converter works:

1. Open the GUI interface by running `main.py`.

2. Enter the distance in miles (e.g., 10) in the input field.

3. Click the "Convert" button.

4. The equivalent distance in kilometers (e.g., 16.09) is displayed below.

5. You can continue to enter and convert more distances as needed.
